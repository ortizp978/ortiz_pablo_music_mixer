Music Mixer / Pablo Ortiz

From a background developed in Cinema 4D there are 4 instruments (drums, guitar, bass and maracas) which will be located in the lower part on some starting points; these must be dragged and dropped onto the podiums that are connected to the speakers; each time one of the instruments is added it will be added to the overall melody.
